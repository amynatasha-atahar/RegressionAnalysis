# Regression Analysis
The aim of the project is to compare four types of regression models in predicting factors that influence total bikes rented. 

# Discussion and Recommendation
* K-Neighbors Regressor has the lowest error compared to other algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor).
* All the classifiers RMSLE result are decreasing because it was tuning by the optimum parameter to improve models forecast accuracy except Random Forest which is slightly increased may be due to hyper-parameter tuning used.
* Use TuneRF before applying Random Forest algorithm to produce a good performance and enhance the optimal parameters for prediction of bike sharing usage (Patil et. al., 2015). 

# Conclusion
The best performance of the algorithm for this project is **K-Neighbors Regressor (KNR)** where the value of RMSLE is the lowest compared to other algorithms.
